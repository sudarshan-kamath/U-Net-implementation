# Implementation of the U-Net segmentation network using PyTorch

The main goal is to create a U-Net network from scratch by understanding the paper. 

Further goals:
- Modification of the MobileNetV2 SSD for segmentation in realtime.
- Training of the UNet on Medical imaging datasets from Kaggle and the Traffic datasets.
- Other optimisations if possible
